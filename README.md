## Hi there, I'm Mykel! 👋

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and React. I love building intuitive user experiences backed by clean, scalable systems. Whether I’m designing front-end components or architecting backend APIs, my main goal is to keep things simple, performant, and maintainable. I thrive most when I'm solving complex problems or learning a new, unfamiliar technology.

### Frame 🔍

I recently developed Frame, an image search platform specifically designed for developers. It abstracts the entire embedding and image search process and deploys infrastructure directly to a user's AWS account. The platform provides image embedding and multimodal similarity search through a user-friendly API.
